        Never Wait To Get Paid Again
        Once you complete a job or send your product to your client, and invoice them, that invoice has value because it’s a legal right to collect payment after a fixed period of time. We can help you “sell” your invoice to a financing institution, that will purchase it for a fee or at a small discount. Your client or customer then pays the financing institution, either directly, or to a lock-box account of which you and the lender own. This is called an “accounts receivable factoring facility”. <br/>
